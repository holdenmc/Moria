todo:
  cleanup memory
  finish this readme
  remove magic numbers
  unequipping something that adds to health/cons does not lower health (does lower max health though?)
  ->unequipping removes a health pot???????
  if you buy something from a store it removes itself, but then when you back in the store it is still there


CONTROLS

in town: 
  q to quit a store menu
  q to quit inventory
  i to view inventory

in dungeon:


anywhere (not in a menu):
  Q to quit game (you lose)
  h to drink a health potion (if you have any)
  wasd to move character (when not in menu)
  numbers/letters if prompted (when leveling up, making character, etc.)
  move "into"/towards something to interact with it - if door is neighboring on
    left, a lets you shop at that store; if a monster is directly above you,
    w initiates combat



FUTURE IMPROVEMENTS
  make inventory viewable in dungeon
  make exp harder to earn if you are fighting low level monsters and you are higher level, and vice versa to reward fighting monsters that are stronger
